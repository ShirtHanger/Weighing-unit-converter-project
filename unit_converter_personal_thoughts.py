"""

Program:

This program will accept a measurement in various measurement units (Both imperial and metric), then convert
it to whatever unit the user asks it to.

It does this by first converting it to a "Base" (grams or milliliters) for the sake of ease

This program does not use APIs or external webpages

Personal Notes:

I have recently begun weighing food for my health, this is the rationale behind the units I chose.
That's really all I have to say."""
