Description:
#######

Without much more to add this week's challenge will be A UNIT CONVERTER.

As a way to assess the skill levels of the overall sub we've decided not to go with anything overly difficult.
In this challenge you're tasked to make a unit converter.
You can work with any units, be it temperature, mass, velocity, volume, etc.
Try and convert from one measurement system to another such as from imperial to metric
or work within the same system such as meters to kilometers to centimeters.
Bonus points for using more extravagant units! Any language can be used for this challenge."""
